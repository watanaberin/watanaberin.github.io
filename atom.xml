&lt;p&gt;In summer 2015 when I was walking by Magus Books, my favorite bookstore in Seattle. At 3 AM morning, my eyes were immediately caught by the title of a book in the yellow glim behind the window. So I went the next morning, bought it, and read it. The book was properly not the best collection of essays I had read, but the title has since then stayed with me “The Moral Obligation To Be Intelligent”. What does that have to do with learning languages?</summary>
