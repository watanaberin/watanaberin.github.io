<p>「你把脚本和调试都丢给 AI 啊」。</p>
<p>我其实有点恼怒，解释了这个工程的复杂程度，但是得到了相同的回答。</p>
<p>也许我只是讨厌不懂得别人恼怒的时候还是说出比 AI 还冰冷的回答。</p>

    <title>学外语如何毁了我</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ_4gzoDDAE">学外语如何毁了我</a><span id="more"></span> </p>
<p>In summer 2015 when I was walking by Magus Books, my favorite bookstore in Seattle. At 3 AM morning, my eyes were immediately caught by the title of a book in the yellow glim behind the window. So I went the next morning, bought it, and read it. The book was properly not the best collection of essays I had read, but the title has since then stayed with me “The Moral Obligation To Be Intelligent”. What does that have to do with learning languages? Does speaking foreign languages make you more intelligent? Depends. Is the ability to speak another language part of intelligence? Not necessarily. But being intelligent and knowing foreign languages do share one thing in common: they are both painful. And by “painful” I don’t mean the ennui of tediously long lectures or vocabulary and grammatical studies or the expense of time for the pursuit of wisdom and knowledge nor even the loneliness your dedication to the endeavor could bring upon you. The pain, the true torment, is the confusion. For the bigger the circle of the known, the greater the contact with the unknown, and the more firmly unlearnt beliefs used to stand, the more helplessly your new identity totters. If you are lucky enough to study Farsi, you may realize that not all beautiful poetry is written in your mother tongue and that Persian epics written in the Sasanian Empire are as beautiful as poems of the Tang Dynasty. If you happen to study Spanish you may realize that what you thought is unique and an aspect of your culture has a similar counterpart in another culture, that the Porto Rican Morcilla is almost identical to the Korean Sundae. If Russian is your language, you may realize that not all the important battles that change the course of human history were fought on your native land, that the Russian defeat of the Golden Horde at the field of Kulikobo is no less significant than the Reconquest of Granada in Spain. Can’t you do this by reading history? One may ask. Yes, but history written by whom, for whom? Because you see, after learning a language, if you care enough, part of you becomes a member of the tribe to which the language belongs. And that cultural schizophrenia can be truly excruciating. That pain, however, cannot be easily offset by the better chances of employment in the job market by the better chances of employment in the job market or the simple pleasure of impressing your friends at the dinner table with political anecdotes played out in five different languages. Why, then, would anyone who’s not a crazy masochist want to learn a foreign language? Yes, to communicate with people. Yes, to travel to different places. Yes, to advance your career in a globalized world. Yes, it is good for your brain. But more importantly, as potentially excruciating as it is for those curious enough to see the world as it is and those brave enough to tear down the veils of bigotry instead of hiding behind the lingustic barrier and refusing to step forward and know your fellow human beings or even the so-called enemie. I am by no means accusing those not fond of foreign languages of being cowards if anything they have to be forever more on their guard of the bigotries the fatuities and the language barrier and constantly seek more reliable sources of information indeed the pursuit of knowledge is almost by definition a sort of masochism and language learning is no exception but in such pain and perhaps only in such pain can we overcome misunderstandings bridge cultures and civilizations and find a world of peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>notion 就是变成 Advanced Excel 才会在「为什么不再使用 notion」的时刻，被贬低不够大道至简的。</p>
<p>我们只是想要靠多巴胺绚烂一下，其实目的根本不重要。</p>

    <title>「are you okay」</title>
    <url>/post/36003e6a.html</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>很难想象「熊家餐厅」已经播到第四季了，捡起第二季从头开始。<span id="more"></span> </p>
<p>大家好像都有躁郁症很擅长同时吵很多件事情，圣诞节聚餐这集，Natalie 说出 「are you okay」，大家汗颜扶额，我们知道有人会爆炸！</p>
<p>这学期有一周伊朗妹缺了一周的日语课，虽然已经在通讯软体上慰问了一番，在课开始前我也尝试预习说点什么。到了课上我还是「are you okay」。f*ck me。我想我在伤心的时候一定不想听到这句话，一旦你说了这句话表明你知道对方并不ok，却要擦掉眼泪对这句没有感情的安慰做出回应。这未必是语言问题因为回到中文，我也只会支支吾吾一句「你还好吗」。</p>
<p>课堂结束后我有悔恨又补了几句，我想最后的拥抱应该比什么都有用（吧）。&#x2F;</p>
